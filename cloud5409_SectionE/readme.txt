factorialLog.py - contains the factorial function that takes the n value and returns it factorial, calculates the time taken for each request and returns the log into CSV that contains RequestId that are generated randomly using the random function, time taken to process for each request, N value and the result that is processed. It also generates a graph between each N value and the time taken to execute the request.

fibonacciLog.py - contains the factorial function that takes the n value and returns it Fibonacci series, calculates the time taken for each request and returns the log into CSV that contains RequestId that are generated randomly using the random function, time taken to process for each request, N value and the result that is processed. It also generates a graph between each N value and the time taken to execute the request.

randomInt.py - contains a program that generates 100 random integers and stores in the text file.

inputText.txt - contains 100 random numbers that are generated using random function.
